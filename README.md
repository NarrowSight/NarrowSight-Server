# NarrowSight-Server
Server component for NarrowSight. Serves the API and stores all things related with NarrowSight in MongoDB.

## Getting started
For now the server component can be installed through cloning this repository and installing the needed dependencies. We used yarn to manage our dependencies.

```
// Getting the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/NarrowSight/NarrowSight-Server.git

// Installing dependencies
$ yarn

// Running the server
$ yarn run start

// Access the API through the url shown in the startup output.
```
